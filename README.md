Bicycle stats, collected in a csv-file, plotted with
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) using [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).

* statistics should be entered into 'stats.csv' (one line per day)
* separator is ','
* date format dd.MM.yyyy
* time format HH:mm:ss

To plot your own statistics, just run `make`. Several plots will be created. My
(semi-current) plots are included here.
