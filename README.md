# fahrrad
bicycle stats, collected in a csv-file, plotted with gnuplot

* statistics should be entered into 'stats.csv' (one line per day)
* separator is ';'
* date format dd.MM.yyyy
* time format (not yet used in any plot) HH:mm:ss

to plot your own statistics, run
```bash
sh fahrrad_plot.sh
```

the result should look something like this
![sample plot](sample.png "sample plot")

have fun!
